# Face Emotion Detection using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect human emotions such as happy, sad, angry, etc., from facial expressions. It is built using Python, Keras/TensorFlow, and trained on the FER2013 dataset. The model is capable of predicting emotions in real-time via webcam input.
